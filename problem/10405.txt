Problem C: Longest Common Subsequence


 Given two sequences of characters, print the length of the longest common subsequence of both sequences. For example, the longest common subsequence of the following two sequences: 
abcdgh
aedfhr
 is adh of length 3. 

 Input consists of pairs of lines. The first line of a pair contains the first string and the second line contains the second string. Each string is on a separate line and consists of at most 1,000 characters 

 For each subsequent pair of input lines, output a line containing one integer number which satisfies the criteria stated above. 
Sample input 
a1b2c3d4e
zz1yy2xx3ww4vv
abcdgh
aedfhr
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
